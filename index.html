            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a passionate Computer Engineering student. I'm focusing on building my skills and gaining experience. I have worked in automation with Fanuc Robots and Rockwell PLCs. I have studied Embedded Engineering extensively in my classes.

                <h3>Pen Plotter</h3>
                <p>I designed and built a pen plotter. I made all CAD files, a Python based UI, and a GCODE controller (from scratch). I designed it to use an Arduino and Python to make it more open source and hackable. I wrote extensive documentation and an article.</p>

                <h3>Pixelated Human Visualizer</h3>
                <p>I used the Google Mediapipe SDK in a new application. It's intended more for recognition, but I used it in a creative way to create this cool pixelated effect. I set the code to run on a linux machine in the GVSU Library so it's on public display.</p>

                <h3>Robomaster EP Core</h3>
                <p>My first major project. I used Python scripting to add additional features (voice commands, following a person using vision, and dancing) to a DJI educational product. I worked with the Robomaster SDK.</p>
